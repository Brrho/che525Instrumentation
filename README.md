We built a control system that connects to three different instruments; a coriolis flow meter, a pressure sensor, and a level radar. I personally aided in the set up of the cartridge deck and inserting appropiate cartridges for the multiple instruments. In addition, I aided in the wiring of the the power supply to the circuit breakers and ultimately the cartridge deck. As a class, we also stripped and replugged ethernet cables to use with the coriolis flow meter and grounded the system to the metal backing of the control system box. The system was tested for grounding and then turned on to see if intruments were operational, which they were.
